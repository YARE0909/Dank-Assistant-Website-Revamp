  {
    "question": "Is this bot 'legal'?",
    "answer": "Yes - this bot is 'legal' and abides by both Discord and Dank Memer's TOS and Community Guidelines. Dank Assistant is also recognised by both the developers and moderators of Dank Memer. Added features are vetted by Dank Memer Mods to ensure that they are allowed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I run commands on this bot?",
    "answer": "From 1st May 2022, we have switched over to slash commands! Prefix-based commands (such as 'd!') will no longer work. There is no change to how reminders work (i.e., reminders will be queued when you invoke a supported Dank Memer command while having the specific command reminder enabled in Dank Assistant)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the blackjack / search / crime / adventure assist feature?",
    "answer": "All of the abovementioned features have been removed from Dank Assistant as they violate Dank Memer Rules. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. Alternatively, you may want to check out our alternative command /currencytable."
  },
  {
    "question": "Slash Commands are not showing! What can I do to run commands on this bot?",
    "answer": "Try kicking and re-inviting the bot. Do ensure that permissions to use slash commands for Dank Assistant in X channel are allowed. Alternatively, you might want to grant full administrative perms to the bot. Should the issue persist, refer to our Support Server's FAQ page for advanced troubleshooting!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use Dank Assistant commands in DMS?",
    "answer": "A big fat L to any of y'all who think this is a great idea. Just invite the bot and use the goddamn channels lmao."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the busarrival command?",
    "answer": "Busarrival is a (proof-of-concept) command users in Singapore can use to find out bus timings for buses serving any bus stop in Singapore! Simply type in a query (stop name or description or code) and select the appropriate autofilled information. It's pretty intuitive, give it a shot!"
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I find outdated or incorrect information in the bot?",
    "answer": "Join our support server and open a support ticket through our custom server bot!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Dank Memer Trending Game is incorrect/outdated!",
    "answer": "As the trending game is manually updated by a group of volunteers, it may take some time for us to find the updated trending game. Alternatively, if you know the new trending game of the day, please join our support server and ping a staff member to update the trending game!"
  },
  {
    "question": "I want to suggest a feature!",
    "answer": "We read through all feature/improvement requests! Join our support server and open a suggestion ticket through our custom server bot!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Bot does not remind me for my selected reminders!",
    "answer": "Do make sure that you have enabled the specific command reminder (by default, they are all disabled). If this issue still persists, make sure that Dank Assistant has the basic required permissions (especially the READ MESSAGES and SEND MESSAGES permission). Finally, do make sure that you are also using the 'pls' prefix."
  },
  {
    "question": "Bot pings that I can use a command again, but the command is still in cooldown!",
    "answer": "You had probably invoked the command first in a channel where Dank Assistant does not have read permissions to, or that bot cooldown and reminders are desynced. To fix this bug, make sure that Dank Assistant can read the channel where your command is invoked. To prevent a chain of incorrect reminders, take a short break and do something else while waiting for commands to sync up! For more information, you may want to join our support server for advanced troubleshooting tips and support (if needed)."
